      <description>Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my fatherâ€”he told me,
&amp;ldquo;Son, don&amp;rsquo;t let it slip away&amp;rdquo;
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
&amp;ldquo;When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days</description>
